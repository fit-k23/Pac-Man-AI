The project is run on Python 12!

Since the environment might be different, the executable for python might be different (python, py, python3,...)

Before running the project, make sure you have the required asset folder at project source!

1. Install requirement
> pip install -r ./requirements.txt
If that did not work, try manual install pygame.

For some reason, tracemalloc package is needed manually installing on some devices while other have it integrated in
python without any installation.


2. Run the program
2.a Run at project source
> python src/main.py
2.b Run at src/
> cd src/
> python main.py
