Since the environment might be different, the executable for python might be different (python, py, python3,...)

Before running the project, make sure you have the required asset folder at project source!

1. Install requirement
> pip install -r ./requirements.txt
If that did not work, try manual install pygame.

2. Run the program
2.a Run at project source
> python src/main.py
2.b Run at src/
> cd src/
> python main.py
